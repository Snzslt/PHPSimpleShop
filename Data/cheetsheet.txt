<form>
GET and POST methods receive data in the network: 
action is the attribute to specify which page we want to open  
To communicate in the network always there is two methods: GET - POST
GET: is a URL
when you type anything in the url and press enter it's get. So with GET the parameters are in the URL
-GET has limit in searching characters 
-when we use GET, it saves in the browsers history
-We see the parameters in the url that is not secure

POST:
Sensitive information always use POST
-It is secure and do not save the history
To see request headers and response headers in the form
-press F12
